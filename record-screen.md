How to record your screen on OS X using QuickTime Player

1. Install [Soundflower](https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/downloads/list) to enable system audio recording. Without `Soundflower`, you will only be able to record audio from your microphone.

2. Open `Audio Midi Setup` and create a new multi-output device.
Select Built-in Output, Built-in Line Output, and Soundflower (2ch)

3. Then rename the device.

To record system audio, open System Preferences Sound then under Outputs, choose your multi-output device (adjust your sound before hand)

4. Open QuickTime Player and start a new screencapture. Choose the audio to go through Soundflower (2ch)

5. Click on a screen to record there.

## Tips

1. If you want to record on multiple monitors, then you have to duplicate QuickTime player in your Applications folder and start a new screencapture.

2. To remove the darkened screen affect, Hide QuickTime Player.
